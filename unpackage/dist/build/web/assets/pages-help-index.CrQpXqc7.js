A smart contract is a computational code that programmatically defines and automatically executes the terms of a contract. These contract codes are stored on the blockchain to ensure transparency, security and reliability of transactions. At the same time the smart contract trading system allows participants to trade without the need for a third party intermediary. The system works on the principle that the contract code will automatically execute a transaction when predefined conditions are met. This means that transactions can be executed without human intervention, thus reducing the possibility of fraud and errors and increasing the efficiency of transactions. The system can execute various types of transactions, such as digital currency transactions, asset swaps, decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions, etc. It can also provide other functions such as decentralized exchange (DEX) operations, automated trading strategy execution and management, and crowdfunding platform operations. These systems provide a more open and transparent trading environment through blockchain technology, enabling participants to trade securely and without the need to trust third parties.
